## ?. Longest Consecutive Sequence
- 🔢 Problem #: ?
- 📅 Date: 2025-07-08
- 🌐 Platform: LeetCode
- 📍 Status: ⚠️ Brute Force Confusion
- ⚠️ Mistake: Used HashSet inside brute force mistakenly
- 🛠 Fix: Use sorting + linear scan in brute force. HashSet should be used only in optimal O(n) version.
- 💡 Flash Tip: Brute Force = no skipping. Check every element with plain logic.

## ?. Longest Consecutive Sequence
- 🔢 Problem #: ?
- 📅 Date: 2025-07-18
- 🌐 Platform: LeetCode
- 📍 Status: Brute Force Confusion
- ⚠️ Mistake: Got confused between loop structures: whether to use two nested for loops or a for + while loop for brute force. Overthought the iteration logic for checking consecutive elements.
- 🛠 Fix: Used outer for loop to iterate each element and inner while loop to count streak by checking current+1 in array. Also realized HashSet belongs to optimal version, not brute-force.
- 💡 Flash Tip: Brute force = outer for + inner while for streak counting.

## 1. Longest Consecutive Sequence
- 🔢 Problem #: 1
- 📅 Date: 2025-07-18
- 🌐 Platform: LeetCode
- 📍 Status: Stuck
- ⚠️ Mistake: Got Confused in inner loop and hashset in Bruteforce Approach
- 🛠 Fix: We should not use hashset for Bruteforce Approach this is for optimal approach and I debug this using chatgpt or dry run using pen and paper
- 💡 Flash Tip: Brute force = outer for + inner while for streak counting and Use Hashset only for Bruteforce Approach.

## 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- 🔢 Problem #: 2
- 📅 Date: 2025-07-18
- 🌐 Platform: LeetCode
- 📍 Status: Solved
- ⚠️ Mistake: No Confusion
- 🛠 Fix: I understand the logic and do dry run with 2 to 3 examples
- 💡 Flash Tip: Do more pratice and understand why we are wrting each line of the code after or before, "THINK LOGICALLY".
